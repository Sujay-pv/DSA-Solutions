Given an integer array nums, return the number of subarrays filled with 0.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,0,0,2,0,0,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
There are 4 occurrences of [0] as a subarray.
There are 2 occurrences of [0,0] as a subarray.
There is no occurrence of a subarray with a size more than 2 filled with 0. Therefore, we return 6.

Solution:
class Solution {
    public long zeroFilledSubarray(int[] nums) {
        long count = 0;  // total subarrays
        long consecutive = 0;  // current streak of zeros

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == 0) {
                consecutive++;
                count += consecutive; // add new subarrays formed
            } else {
                consecutive = 0; // reset streak
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
